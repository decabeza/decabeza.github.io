    Hey! Anyway, you seem to be curious! Ok...

    Hi, I'm Alberto GarcÃ­a, a designer living in Madrid. Fascinated by technology, films and videogames.

    # UX/UI designer
    ================
    I worked on several projects creating clean and simple interfaces for websites and mobile applications.

    # Front-end developer
    =====================
    I code my own designs using HTML5, SASS, Foundation and git. Also I'm used to working in projects developed in Ruby on Rails.

    # Keep in contact
    =================
    You can follow me on http://github.com/decabeza or send me an email to alberto@decabeza.es


    Alberto.
    I love not man the less, but Nature more.
